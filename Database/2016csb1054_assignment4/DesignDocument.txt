====================================================

======================================== Implementation of the programme ======================================

	The programme first runs the schema of the Database which is given in the file "database.sql". It creates 
	the databse and 4 tables into it. All the four tables are initially empty. 

	Then user run the Programme with -i option which insert the random data in the tables.
	The Data Ascess LAyer Class have many random function each with a specific task to save random data.
	All the data ascessing part from the database is done through this class to maintain the soft coding part.

	There exist a queries.properties file in which all the queries related to the databse are written along with the username and password
	of mysql as ha key value pair.

	As the programme runs It first create the DataAscessLayer Class object named "dal". This takes username and password from the queries.properties file.
	Through this object we call the random function listed in the readme to generate some random data.
	All the data is stored in the array.
	These array is passed to function "insertInDatabase()" to insert into different tables of the databse.
	As the data is inserted user can query on the data by running the programme with -q option.
