1. Sample Run |
--------------+
	
	Sample Run :
		First open a terminal and run facts_gen.py--------------------------- $ python facts_gen.py
		Then open a new terminal and run loguc_app.py------------------------ $ python logic_app.py
		
--------------+
2. Files	: |
--------------+

	facts_gen.py			: It generates the facts and rules after reading from machine_info.yaml file
	facts_and_rules.pl		: It stores all the rules and facts generated by the above file
	logic_app.py 			: It invoke the facts_and_rules.pl file and produce the outputs
	machine_info.yaml		: It stores the machine info


-----------------------------+
3. What does this program do |
-----------------------------+

	This  programme opens the machine_info.yaml file and parse it through yaml parser
	Then it creates a dictionary to store the relevent information from the file
	All the important facts are stored in the facts_and_rules.pl file and then it append some important prolog rules
	to get the output.
	Then using watchdog it watches the file to detect any changes. As soon as there is any change 
	IT updates the facts_and_rules.pl and then we can query again.
	
	logic_app.py simply ask user to run which query and then it simply runs it and provide outputs.
	


---------------+
4. Assumptions |
---------------+
	1. facts_gen.py should be running so that it can automatically generate facts_and_rules.pl file.
	
	2. The machine_info.yaml file should be provided as in the sample file.
