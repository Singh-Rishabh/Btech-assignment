======================================== Implementation of the programme ======================================

	The programme takes a command line argument from the user as a file name, When programme starts running it opens the file user inputted
	and read file line by line. For each line it apply the beaytiful soup and then extract the necessary information like the test and href of the links. 
	We have to apply the beautiful soup every line because we also need the line numbers. Then programme store the details of the link in different list.
	Like it store the href of all the links in href_list and the text of links in name_list. It also store the whole link cendentail in the a_list.
	A special List named check_list store the details related to duplicates links. i.e if the link occur once in the html file then it will be zero for that link
	but if any link occur more than once then it will be non zero. This help us to print the details of the duplicate links.

	The second part of programme takes a user input and then perform the desired task related to delete the links. It useses the decompose method of the 
	Beautiful soup to perform this actions. The various actions are:

		
		1. "A" - Retain all the links and write the outpot in output.html.dedup file
		2. "F" - Retain all the first occurences of the Duplicate links and then delete all the rest links and write outpot in output.html.dedup file
		3. "<sequence of number seprated by comma>" - This retain the links written and delete all the rest and write outpot in output.html.dedup file
