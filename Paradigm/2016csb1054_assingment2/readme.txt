Sample Run:
	(Assumin you are in the required Directory)
	Direclty run code
		javac *.java 				======  Compile the java code
		java mainClass				======  Run java main file

	Run code through the jar files
		java -cp 2016csb1054.jar mainClass


When we compile the main class it will ask user to input the sorting alogrithm so that it can sort the array according to input given by user.
For sample example we have only 3 sorting algorithm which are 
	bubble-sort
	Insertion-Sort
	Selection-Sort

NOTE* User need to input the sorting algorithm name as given above ignoring the case.

The code for various sorting algorithm are taken from geeks for geeks to show working of the code.
